This repository is very outdated and I'm keeping it only for historical porpuses. This way I can tell where I started and hopefully encourage myself to go futher each time. 

This repo was the result of a 1 week internship at YLD during my mid term pause in 2015.
The main objective was to learn the basics of a web app and get in touch with the tools provided by Node.js and its modules.
